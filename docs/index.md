# FlexiFlow

A small async component engine with events, state machines, and a minimal CLI.

## Key Features

- **Components** — Declarative rules and pluggable state machines
- **Async Event Bus** — Priority, filters, sequential or concurrent delivery
- **Persistence** — JSON for dev, SQLite for production, with snapshot history
- **Config Introspection** — Validate before you run with `explain()`
- **Minimal CLI** — Demo and debug without writing a harness

## Install / Quick Start

```bash
pip install flexiflow
```
